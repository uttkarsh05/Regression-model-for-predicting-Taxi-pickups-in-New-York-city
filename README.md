we will build regression models that can predict the number of taxi pickups in New York city at any given time of the day. 
These prediction models will be useful, for example, in monitoring traffic in the city.
The data set for this problem is given in files dataset_1_train.txt and dataset_1_test.txt as separate training and test sets. 
The first column in each file contains the time of a day in minutes, and the
second column contains the number of pickups observed at that time. 
The data set covers taxi pickups recorded during different days in Jan 2019 (randomly sampled across days and time of that day).
We will fit regression models that use the time of the day (in minutes) as a predictor and predict the average number of taxi pick ups at that time. 
The models will be fitted to the training set, and evaluated on the test set. 
The performance of the models will be evaluated using the R^2 metric.
